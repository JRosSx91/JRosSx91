I've always been passionate about science and technology since I was a child. I'm fascinated by the power of computers to solve complex problems and improve people's lives. I became interested in computers at a very young age, when I had my first encounter with a Windows 3.1 computer. Since then, I haven't stopped learning and developing my knowledge and skills in the field of system administration.

I started in the world of programming years later, and it was then that I discovered a perfect analogy with my love for the stars and the universe: the opportunity to create systems with your own laws.

What I love most about programming is the constant need to learn new things and the opportunity to solve unique and challenging problems. I believe this passion for continuous learning and problem solving makes me a strong candidate for any company looking for a passionate and dedicated programmer.

I started with basic knowledge of HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript to build web applications with a server-side PHP programming. From there I started using Js frameworks like Angular or Vue. Currently, I'm trying to expand my knowledge of TypeScript and Python as much as possible. Someday I would like to be a Full StackðŸ˜„.

I'm excited about the opportunity to further develop my skills in the programming field and look forward to bringing value to any team I have the opportunity to work on.
