### Hi there, I'm IvÃ¡n ðŸ‘‹
[![Github](https://img.shields.io/github/followers/JRosSx91?label=Follow&style=social)](https://github.com/JRosSx91)

Since I was a child, I've always been passionate about science and technology. I'm fascinated by the power of computers to solve complex problems and improve people's lives. I became interested in programming at a very young age, when I had my first encounter with a Windows 95 computer. Since then, I haven't stopped learning and developing my skills in the field.

I'm working hard to acquire a solid set of technical skills in programming. So far the Frontend has been what I have spent most of my time on, but I hope to progress until I can be considered a Full StackðŸ˜„. I've also worked in mobile and web application development, which has given me a deeper understanding of how computer systems work.

What I love most about programming is the constant need to learn new things and the opportunity to solve unique and challenging problems. I believe this passion for continuous learning and problem solving makes me a strong candidate for any company looking for a passionate and dedicated programmer.

I'm excited for the opportunity to further develop my skills in the programming field and look forward to bringing value to any team I have the opportunity to work on.
